#### Introduction of WLE dataset
This human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities dataset above). The approach we propose for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer. The "how (well)" investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.
In this work (see the paper) we first define quality of execution and investigate three aspects that pertain to qualitative activity recognition: the problem of specifying correct execution, the automatic and robust detection of execution mistakes, and how to provide feedback on the quality of execution to the user. We tried out an on-body sensing approach (dataset here), but also an "ambient sensing approach" (by using Microsoft Kinect - dataset still unavailable)
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).



### Method selected the relavent features
...we used the feature selection algorithm based on correlation proposed by
Hall [14]. The algorithm was conﬁgured to use a “Best First” strategy based on backtracking. 

### Features selected by original authors
In the belt, were selected the *mean* and *variance* of the roll,
*maximum*, *range* and *variance* of the accelerometer vector,
*variance* of the gyro and *variance* of the magnetometer. ... 7

      "magnet_belt_x"     "magnet_belt_y"     "magnet_belt_z"
      

In the arm, the *variance* of the accelerometer vector and the
*maximum* and *minimum* of the magnetometer were selected. ... 3

In the dumbbell, the selected features were the *maximum* of
the  acceleration,  *variance*  of  the  gyro  and  *maximum*  and 
*minimum* of the magnetometer  ... 4

In the forearm, the *sum* of the pitch and the *maximum* and *minimum* of the gyro were selected. ... 3

### Prediction algorithm
 used  a  Random  Forest  approach
 To improve recognition performance we used an ensemble of classiﬁers using the “Bagging”method 
10 random forests and each forest was implemented with 10 trees.
