### Method selected the relavent features
...we used the feature selection algorithm based on correlation proposed by
Hall [14]. The algorithm was conﬁgured to use a “Best First” strategy based on backtracking. 

### Features selected by original authors
In the belt, were selected the mean and variance of the roll,
maximum, range and variance of the accelerometer vector,
variance of the gyro and variance of the magnetometer.
_belt "avg_roll_belt", "var_roll_belt", 

In the arm, the variance of the accelerometer vector and the
maximum and minimum of the magnetometer were selected.

In the dumbbell, the selected features were the maximum of
the  acceleration,  variance  of  the  gyro  and  maximum  and 
minimum of the magnetometer

In the forearm, the sum of the pitch and the maximum and minimum of the gyro were selected.


### Prediction algorithm
 used  a  Random  Forest  approach
 To improve recognition performance we used an ensemble of classiﬁers using the “Bagging”method 
10 random forests and each forest was implemented with 10 trees.
